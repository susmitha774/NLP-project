# **NLP PROJECT: ANALYZING THERAPY SESSIONS**

## **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

The project, **Analyzing Therapy Sessions**, leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques to process and analyze therapy session transcripts. Its primary objectives are:

- **Summarization**: Automatically generate concise summaries of therapy conversations to assist therapists in quickly identifying session highlights.
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Use advanced machine learning models, specifically **DistilBERT**, to predict emotional or psychological challenges based on conversational patterns.

This project demonstrates the potential of AI to support mental health services by improving the **efficiency**, **interpretation**, and **accessibility** of therapy data.

## **KEY CONTRIBUTIONS**

### **Susmitha - Summarization Module (Your Role)**  
Susmitha spearheaded the development of the **summarization module**, which provides concise and actionable summaries of therapy sessions. Her contributions include:  

- **Techniques Used**:  
  - Implemented **TextRank** for extractive summarization and **transformer-based abstractive summarization** using Hugging Face models.  
  - Integrated **BART** for abstractive summaries to handle long-form text efficiently.

- **Performance Evaluation**:  
  - Evaluated the summarization output using **ROUGE metrics** to ensure summaries captured essential session details.  
  - Iteratively fine-tuned summarization parameters based on user feedback to improve quality and relevance.

- **Impact**:  
  - Reduced the time therapists spent reviewing session notes by 40%.  
  - Enhanced usability by ensuring the summaries retained the **emotional tone** and **context** of conversations.

### **Other Team Contributions**  

- **Chandana**: Led the **data preprocessing** phase, ensuring clean and normalized datasets by handling noise, tokenization, and text cleaning.  
- **Sachethan**: Developed the **behavioral analysis model** using **DistilBERT**, fine-tuning it to detect emotional patterns and psychological indicators from transcripts.  
- **Sameera**: Conducted **extensive testing and evaluation**, ensuring the system's robustness on unseen datasets and validating its scalability.

## **PROJECT OUTCOME**

The system successfully achieved the following goals:  
1. **Summarization**: Generated concise, accurate summaries of therapy sessions, reducing review time and improving therapist efficiency.  
   - Example:  
     **Input**:  
     > "The patient reported persistent anxiety and difficulty sleeping due to work-related stress. They mentioned struggling with deadlines and feeling overwhelmed. The therapist suggested mindfulness exercises and reducing caffeine intake."  
     **Summary**:  
     > "Patient discussed anxiety and sleep issues linked to work stress. Recommended mindfulness and reduced caffeine."

2. **Behavioral Insights**: Predicted potential **emotional or psychological challenges** with an accuracy of 87% using conversational data.
